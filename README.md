Hello!

I am Jack Kolker, and am currently a studying Aerospace and Computer Science at ISU.  I'm very interested in learning about how aerosystems utilize algorithms and electronics to optimize flight controls and operations.  I am an intern at BAE Systems working in the Satellite Navigation software team to develop communication software between satellites and ground stations to provide precision GPS systems. About me, playing music is my favorite hobby as I play 5 different instruments.  
Thanks for reading ðŸ˜Ž
